    <section>
      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
      <p>A long time ago I fired up my text-only web browser for the first time. I followed all the links. There was a menu item labeled "view source." "What is that?" I selected it and the bones of the page I was viewing were revealed to me. "OK, I can do <em>this</em>."</p>
      <p>You can still find my first website if you use the wayback machine: <%= link_to "don't look", 'https://web.archive.org/web/19961018085715/http://www.arthritis.org/' %>. We thought it was pretty cool.</p>
      <p>Over the years, I have written about CSS, Flash, SVG and more. I used to keep recipes on my site. It's all still around here on a hard drive.</p>
      <p>These days, I am a certified (University of Washington) Ruby on Rails developer.</p>
